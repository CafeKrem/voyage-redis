I'm a subclass of VOContainer.

I'm used to describe how to store object in database and some properties inherent to redis.

API: 

Time to live redis properties.
* ttlDuration: aTimeInSecond
* ttlUnixTimeStamp: anEpochTimestamp
with those methods you can define the time to leave of your Object store in Redis
